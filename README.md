# dcs325-portfolio
Portfolio from Bates College, 2026 Winter Term, DCS325

This is my working portfolio from the course Web Development. Taught by Professor Barry Lawson, the projects shown here span from January 2025 through April 2025. See descriptions below to understand what each example is showcasing, and what reflections I have on it. In addition, my reflections on the semester overall are below.

example-1: HTML, CSS, JS, and SSH
I found that HTML builds the basic layout of a website, CSS makes it easy to generalize stylization, and JavaScript adds the interactive stuff like buttons and animations. They're super flexible and work everywhere, but managing them separately can get messy on bigger projects. This example is also the first I uploaded to my "domain of one's own." To do this, I set up an SSH key, and a corresponding alias bates-domain='ssh gusmcgar@catapult.bates.edu'. I found SSH keys make logging into servers or pushing to GitHub way easier. To set it up, I ran ssh-keygen to create a key, then added my public key to my GitHub/Catapult account so I could connect without entering my password every time.


example-2: TailwindCSS
Tailwind has made stylization extremely easy. It lets me style my website directly in my HTML using utility classes, so I don’t have to write a bunch of custom CSS. It’s super fast and flexible, but the class-heavy markup looked pretty messy when I was first learning how to use it.



example-3: React, ShadCN/UI, Accessibility, and Cursor
React has made developing large scale projects incredibly easily, especially when used in tandem with Cursor. Utilizing components, particularly those pulled from ShadCN/UI, is far easier when they are already created, and Cursor can just slide them in. There is also an accessibility aspect here, as on this page users can choose colors that work better for them. This is important such people with disabilities such as colorblindness, which disproportionately affects women.
